Ice Cream Availability Copier for Moodle
==========================
This is a simple mod that allows you to copy availability conditions from one Moodle activity to another in the same course.

To Install
==========
Clone or unzip+rename into a folder called "icecream" in the moodle mod directory. Visit Site Administration -> Notifications to complete the installation. There are no settings. 

Add an instance of the activity to the course you wish to use it in.

To Use
===========
Select the source activity from the drop down list "Clone From." The availability restrictions should appear beneath the list in human readable and code formats. Select the target activity from the drop down list "Clone To." If everything looks ok, press the "save changes" button.

If you choose to manually enter availability code into the "manual input" text area, this will take precedence over the "Clone To" dropdown list, and you are a very brave person. May the force be with you.

Hope its useful. Enjoy.
